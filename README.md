Jump
====
Try to build the Diablo-like Jump game base on Cocos2dx-2.2.3.

A jump game based on cocos2dx2.2.3

tips: 
1.If you try to build this solution , please download cocos2dx-2.2.3 framework first, then  put this Jump folder into the "/project" folder under the cocos2dx directory.
2.If you caught any trouble when you try to build this proj in android , you can do follow steps:
    a. open the win32 proj in vs2010.
    b. right click the proj, open the poperties tab.
    c. select the post-building events and make it actvie.

  those three steps will refresh the codes which will be used in eclipse, if you still can not build it in eclipse anyway, I think you can send a mail to me.
